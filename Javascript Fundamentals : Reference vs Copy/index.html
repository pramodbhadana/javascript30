    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let age = 100;
    // let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2);
    // age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2);

    // let name = 'Wes';
    // let name2 = name;
    // console.log(name, name2);
    // name = 'wesley';
    // console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'heeee hawww';
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));

    /* 
    Learnings from this lesson : 

    the primitive types string, number and boolean works by copy i.e. 
    you assign a variable to another, it just copies the value and changing
    the first or second variable does not affect the other. 

    Arrays and object on the other hand, work by reference. On changing one of the 
    variables the other one will be changed too. 
    
    How to make independent copies in case of 
    
    1. Arrays : (make a new array from the previous one)
    Array.slice()
    Array.from()
    [].concat()
    [..spread]

    2. Objects :
    Object.assign will work when the object does not have other objects as 
    property values.

    One not so recommended way is to first covert the object to JSON and 
    then again convert it back to object. 
    This method does not work in case object has methods as properties.

    A good way would be use deep copy method from a third party library such 
    as Lodash.
